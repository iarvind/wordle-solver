# wordle-solver
To use this, run with python3 (It should run on Python 2 but I am noob on python and tested only on 3 :P )

Go to the working directory and run via 

> python3 runner.py

## There are 3 inputs:

#### Last word:

What word did you start with?

#### Fix positions:

The green ones. Input format: `<char>:<pos1>,<pos2>,...` To end, input `.`

#### Variable positions:

The characters at wrong locations. Input format: `<char>:<pos1>,<pos2>,...` To end, input `.`

Thanks!
